**Notice:** Hosting of the Rivenvale bot on Discord may be discontinued in the future. If youâ€™d like to continue using Rivenvaleâ€™s grading system, instructions are provided below on how to host it yourself. Please read and understand the **Usage Restrictions** before proceeding.

# Deploying Rivenvale on Your Device
## ðŸ”’ Usage Restrictions

- You may clone and deploy the Rivenvale repository for **personal use only**.
- **Commercial use is strictly prohibited.**
- You may modify the code for personal use, but you must not change the **Rivenvale logo** or name when setting up the bot. The logo is provided in the repository as `Rivenvale_logo.png`.
- If you build your own bot using Rivenvaleâ€™s code as reference, you must use a unique logo and name to give your bot its own identity. You may not reuse Rivenvaleâ€™s proprietary assets, such as `bg.png`, `best.pt`, or any other files included in the repository.

## ðŸ“¥ Cloning the Repository

To get started, clone the repository to your device:

1. **Check Git Installation**  
Make sure Git is installed. You can download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads) or verify with:

```
git --version
```

2. **Clone the Repository**  
Navigate to the directory where you want to install the bot, then run:

```
git clone https://github.com/ExerentPrime/Rivenvale.git
```

3. **Verify Files**  
Confirm that `bot.py` and other asset files are present:

```
ls
```

## ðŸ”§ Environment Setup

Youâ€™ll need a `.env` file to store your **Discord bot token** and **OCR API key**.

1. **Get a Discord Bot Token**
   - Create an application and bot in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).  
   - Copy your bot token.

2. **Get an OCR API Key**
   - Visit [OCR.Space](https://ocr.space/ocrapi/freekey).  
   - Register for a free key, or purchase a PRO plan for higher limits.

3. **Create the .env File**  
Inside your project folder, create a file named `.env` and add your keys:

```
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=AAAa99A99AA9A9Aaa99AAA9A999Aa.aAAaaA.AAAAaAaAAA_aaaaa99999AaAaAaAAaa
OCR_API=K99999999999999
```

## ðŸ“‹ Requirements

### System Requirements
- **Python**: 3.8 or higher (tested on 3.12.3). Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **OS**: Windows, macOS, or Linux (must support image processing libraries like OpenCV).

### Python Dependencies
Install required packages with:

```
pip install aiohttp discord.py Pillow requests pandas python-dotenv ultralytics opencv-python numpy
```

## ðŸš€ Running the Bot
1. Clone the repository.  
2. Install dependencies.  
3. Create and configure your `.env` file.  
4. Ensure all asset files are in the project directory.  
5. Start the bot:

```
python bot.py
```

## ðŸ”„ Updating and Maintenance

Rivenvale is updated regularly with new Warframe patches. To keep your bot working correctly, update the code and refresh certain data files:

### Update the Code
Pull the latest changes:

```
git pull origin main
```

### Refresh Data Files
The bot downloads `roll_data.xlsx` and `weapon_data.txt` on first run. After a Warframe patch, delete these files and restart the bot to refresh:

```
rm roll_data.xlsx weapon_data.txt
```
